The MOOE has long been questioned by Congress themselves but recent social media campaign makes it appear it was only the Duterte is questioning its manner of liquidation. A quick search will lead you to a timeline that completely tells a different story.

An article in the University of the Philippines School of Economics [Per Se questioned the MOOE liquidation](https://econ.upd.edu.ph/perse/?p=2019) [[ss-per-se]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mooe/Screenshot 2024-01-22-perse-mooe.png)] around January 2013 while an article in Sunstar highlights that [Congress has supposedly changed it already](liquidate-through-receipt-2013) [[ss-sunstar]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mooe/Screenshot 2024-01-22-sunstar.png)] around February 2013.

These two links alone point to the controversial MOOE liquidation practice. It should be changed or updated for the benefit of the people and our country.
