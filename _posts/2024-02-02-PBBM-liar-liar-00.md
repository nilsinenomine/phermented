On January 23, 2024, ABS-CBN published a statement of PH's stance on ICC.

Yet on this day, February 2, 2024, UNTV News and Rescue reported that ICC representative is inside Malacanang Palace.

We should all understand that quasi-judicial body like ICC will not enter a country without invitation or go-signal from the current government.

If we give PBBM the benefit of a doubt, then it means the people under him do not actually respect his statements and he is not the one governing. He is not the one leading the people in government? If that is the case, then we definitely have to look more into who is running the show, because that is simply unconstitutional.

### Never Trust a Marcos Again.

Philippines is a sovereign nation. The ICC has no jurisdiction over us. How dare this representative make suggestions against a working program that is successful in curbing the ill that is the New People's Army.

We've had it. Never trust a Marcos that seeks and follows advise of an entity that we are not a party of. The people is 
where the power comes from. The will of the people is what is sovereign. Never the will of the few.
