What kind of a Commander-in-Chief would be absent during the Army's Founding Celebration?

The kind who should not hold the power and one that the power should speak out against.

Would you want to serve a Commander-in-Chief would could not even stand to attend a celebration? If he can not stand against "flu-like" symptom, can you imagine what he will do in face of a dreadful war?
