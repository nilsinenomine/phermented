In an article published by Philippine News Agency titled "[Why there is a need for Charter Change][pna-chacha-202312]", it is clear who are the main proponents and leading the most recent effort of this supposed Charter Change.

We quote, 'Last Dec. 17, **House Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez** said the **country's lawmakers** would make "another pitch for constitutional amendments next year, focusing on economic provisions deemed very prohibitive" at present.' Emphasis ours. 

So, who stands to gain?

The article clearly indicated a strong opposition to the idea of Charter Change during this administration, the Senate is not keen on any moves towards updating our constitution.

With strong statements ahead of House Speaker proclamation that the country's lawmakers will move to change the constitution, it can be obviously inferred that someone leading this move. The Senate afterall have stronger mandate from the people compared to the House of Representatives

## Who Leads and Who Benefits

Nothing is certain, but one question that has a clear answer is: Who leads the House of Representatives?
