A known Marcos loyalist turned Marcos critic has long received death threats when she started talking against the 2022 Philippine Presidential race winner BongBong Marcos. Today she release redacted photos of a Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) confidential report naming "Bonget" (a known nickname) BongBong Marcos.

I'm sure the first question on your mind is whether the document is legitimate or not. One thing is certain, this information has certainly been alluded to by Former President Rodrigo Duterte.

*Update* Examine the report and you can clearly see that the heading is "Pre-Operation Report". This indicates based on a confidential informant's report, PDEA agents did due diligence to file and request "Authority to Operate" outlining the type of operation they will be performing, time of operation, list & number of personnel involved, and assets to be used during such operation.

It is also clear that there is no Control No. that was redacted in the document. As to what happened to this request, let's wait for the truth to come out.

In light of this update, the title of this article originally "President BBM named as Drug User in PDEA Confidential Report" will be changed "President BBM named Person of Interest in PDEA Surveillance/Casing Operation for Use of Illegal Drugs"
