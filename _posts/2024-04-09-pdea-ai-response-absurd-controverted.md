On April 02, the official facebook page of Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) issued a statement addressuing the [document released by Maharlika.]({% post_url 2024-04-01-bbm-poi-narco-user-pdea %})

Below is [PDEA's response][pdea-addresses-maharlika-released] through their page.

![PDEA's Response][pdea-response]

PDEA's response that it is AI generated is absurd and plain stupid. Any half-decent forger can create the kind of document that Maharlika released. One only needs to recall how Quiapo used to be home or source of more complicated document that Maharlika showed and released.

It however lent weight to how vast the network is against those who are abusing power. They are ready to leak important information to certain individuals, in the name of righting wrongs and for justice. They even leaked that the response to allegations to BBM's drug use will utilize blaming or pointing to generative AI. 

So, how was it controverted? Read for yourselves.

The author of the letter in effect challenges the PDEA to bring it into a formal investigation and inquiry. Will they respond to it as intended or will they play another absurd and stupid response?
