On January 6, 2024 a page [tagged](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid028S7weB7fb3UokiPdNMt3DJoyzZUr1GPCDDqYo3R9zFPDQfKm6pKU4idy6tn6MVQKl&id=100090068640824) the writer Krizette Laureta Chu to question [her post][klc-sounds-alarm] sounding an alarm and begging the Philippine Supreme Court, Military, and Police to not let the people behind this subtle campaign to change the constitution. 

To have some semblance of preservation of the post, we took a screenshot of it for your reference here. ![Screenshot](/assets/images/so-it-begins/Screenshot_2024-01-12_at_15-21-17.png)

The signature campaign is what could fall into the People's Initiative to reform or change the constitution. The campaign paper however is so sparse in detail but broad in implication.

In the following days after the sounding of the alarm, several vloggers who were Pro-BBM during campaign period is now at a 180 turn decrying the efforts being made by the present administration and its allies to change the constitution. They also picked up the story and formulated their own analysis and sounded similar alarm to their audience. The sequence of who picked up the story and formed an thoughtful analysis is not something we processed but there were more than six of them with varying level of depth and nuance in its conjectures. Conjectures which we also believe to be justified given all known conditions otherwise, our post title should be entirely different.

## How to Change the Philippine Constitution

There are three publicly known legal ways. If there are any other legal way, let us know through our email.

* Constitutional Convention (ConCon)
* People's Initiative (PI)
* Constituent Assembly (ConAss)
We are not lawyers, but we hope our brief and oversimplified explaination of each of the above methods can help.

### Constitutional Convention

In this mechanism, the people votes or puts certain individual into key position to study or analyze aspects of our constitution that needs to be changed for the interest of the people of the country.

The changes needed are then made into a proposal exhausting the pros and cons according to the times and/or political climate of the country.

These proposals are then potentially made into a plebiscite for the people to vote on.

### People's Initiative

Another mechanism to change the constitution is through People's Initiative. And it is exactly as it is named, an action initiated by the people whom the government derives its powers to govern.

Unfortunately, there is a major flaw in the current available form. The law to implement this is lacking, thus, the Judiciary asked the Senate to address the flaw.

As ordinary citizens, the major one we can see is that it can actually be initiated by private entity with vested interest in funding a campaign to change certain aspects of our law that hinders their agenda.

### Constituent Assembly

Constituent Assembly. Congress constitutes itself to change the charter.

There is a reason why a group of crocodiles is called a congress.

It might be a good idea to avoid this method with all our might specially if we can not trust our Congress.

## Subversive Approach is Deception

### Ayuda in Exchange for Signature

If you've diligently clicked the link regarding [KLC sounding the alarm][klc-sounds-alarm] to verify our initial claim, and investigated other post of fellow Filipinos, you will find that the reasoning given to those who do read documents before signing is not true to the content of the document being signed. 

A true initiative does not need to hide behind any cloak or veil. Efforts of private individuals during this process is important to be as transparent as possible. It must be an open and public discussion where the general public has time to think through its consequences and those who see problems are free to question the effort without fear or any consequence.

As you will see, if you attempted to verify the claim, the people were given incomplete information, rushed, and a carrot was dangled with thorough discussion on the process' pros and cons. The effort is fishy.

On top of this, a TV Spot has been paid to promote Charter Change.

Do you know how much a TV Spot costs? No? Try to dig a little and ask yourself, if the effort is indeed something that an individual can initiate? Ask yourself, who could affort to pay for a TV Spot? Who stands to gain? Does it present it excruciating detail who will gain and what will be lost - like any other ad that airs the first time, there is a long version, and eventually a shorted version. Does it do this? Ask yourself, what does it promise?

If it is all unclear to you, we are bold enough to claim, that it is intended to be as vague as possible. Any manipulator will make bold claims with vauge conditions and parameters. To us, there is deception. There is intent to deceive. There is intent to rush.

Do not be deceived, sound the alarm to our fellow Filipinos. Talk to our fellow Filipinos and ask what they know about this subject and bring to light what you are able to verify yourself.

### Media Blitz

ABS-CBN used to have several articles citing major institution and the head of state himself that Charter Change is not a priority and probl.

* [Charter change a 'problematic pursuit' at this time: UP professors][up-prof-chacha-problematic], [Screenshot][up-prof-chacha-problematic-ss]
* [Marcos Jr. says ammending the Constitution is not his priority][bbm-chacha-not-prio], [Screenshot][bbm-chacha-not-prio-ss]

And do you know who is the majority stakeholder of ABS-CBN now?

["Romualdez-owned firm has 51% stake; TeleRadyo signing off"][abs-cbn-stakeholder]

And what is the general perception that ABS-CBN is publishing today regarding Charter Change?

P.S.: Just in case you can't read the cache anymore, we took screenshots of the cached articles above to ensure a copy is preserved.
