When one of the big [media in the Philippines recounted President Bong2x Marcos'es promises](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/specialreports/876240/president-bongbong-marcos-plans-and-promises-a-look-back/story/]) we can't see continuity at all. It was all a trail of broken promises.

### Promises
#### Ending Bureaucratic Processes

One only has to investigate how Malasakit Center was operated pre-BBM and compare it to the changes that happens when he took office. 

Examine the effective non-political process of PCSO and PhilHealth before he took office and examine the changes that took place he took office.

Is this what the end of bureaucratic processes looks like?

#### Energy, Power Supply

Examine his response or blame towards a smaller distrubition company over an multi-day island wide power disruption.

#### Tourism Powerhouse

What a PR nightmare when the released tourism video contained footage of other countries. There was obvious rush and shortcuts requested & taken to release it the way it got released. We do not lack creative talent in the Philippines.

The head of tourism took no accountability. All is well in their garden, the grass is green.

#### 20/Kilo Rice

This was an obvious laughable promise. It should've been a red flag already but there were too may red flag from the opposing party as well.

#### Tax System

Tax was and is not a easy topic to tackle, our only comment is that career and long term Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno isn't keen on the blanket statements but insists on imposition of "correct" taxes. 

Update: On January 10, 2024, Finance Secretary Diokno has been replaced by Ralph Recto. Our guess is that Diokno stood his ground on correctness and the palace didn't like his opinion.

#### Technology Advancement

They tout number of registered people through PhilSys. A system where the dark web has an alleged dump of its data.

Several websites were easily defaced by script kiddies and professional hackers dissatisfied by the current administration's performance.

#### Face-to-Face Classes

How is this even a promise worthy of National Interest? Education? Face-to-face classes is not the sole factor for improving or ensuring an educated populace. Besides, it is expected that everyone will have to operate like pre-pandemic once we have herd immunity.

## Uncounted Promises

### Continuity

#### ICC

We have a fully functionality Justice System. There is nothing more to say than this if one really reviewed the charter of the ICC.

#### War on Drugs

He did not promises anything related to drugs but a promise of continuity has be heavily leaned on.

Talk to any PUV/PUJ driver, they will say straight to your face that drug deals are back and out in the open again.

Update 1: Last December 2023, there were rumors about politicians involved in drugs.

Update 2: Early January 2024, it has been rumored as well that PBBM's opposing party knew of a video that directly implicate the current president even during the campaign period. They could not use it as it will also tarnish their candidates image.

#### Freedom of Speech

Several vloggers had their Facebook accounts all of sudden completely deleted and banned for supposed community standards violation. It is worthy to note that the vloggers whose account were deleted/banned were strong supporters of BBM during the campaing period. Around 3rd to 4th quarter of 2023 they began sounding alarm on how the present administration is conducting itself, seeming against the interest of the people and against the very promises he made during the campaign period.

It is also worthy to note that Former President Duterte's critics never had their account deleted/banned for criticizing FPRRD.
