You may have heard, "those who don't learn from history, is doomed to repeat it", and we are quite certain that our version of that word of wisdom rings a bell. 

> ang hindi marunong lumingon sa pinanggalingan ay hindi makakarating sa paroroonan

Which roughly translates to "those who don't look back (learn the mistakes and successes of the past) will not reach their destination", you get the drift.

In Philippine History, when the last name Marcos is mentioned, what emotions and questions does it evoke?
