## We call on our Military and Police to Protect the Constitution.

Our Dear Militarymen and Policemen,

We the people ask you to study your mandate to protect the constitution and the people whom the powers of the Government are derived from.

The House of Representative have demonstrated how it will use its power to supress the press and the people by calling forth unwarranted suspension of franchise of the press
and of having certain individuals vocally opposed against the administration to be removed from their job. This is a clear violation of our freedom of expression.
