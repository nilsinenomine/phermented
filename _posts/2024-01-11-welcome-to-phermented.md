We wanted so much to play with the word "Bagoong Pilipinas" to highlight how briny, oceanic, and fishy the 2023-present administration is but at the same time also do not want our articles to be lost simply because of a copyright claim to a common word. So we have to find something else. Bagoong is generally a fermented fish, kril, or shrimp paste, with fermented as its prominent property. It is a Philippine condiment. Some Filipinos are accustomed to it, but definitely not all. So, here is our wordplay instead - PHermented.

Join us for our love of our country as we point to its ills and hopefully contribute a change in the mindset of our fellow Filipinos.
